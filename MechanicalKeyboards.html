                    <p>As programmers, we spend alot of time with our keyboards so I find it important that the experience is enjoyable and benifits your productivity. Mechanical Keyboards are the go to for people with typing based jobs because each key has more of a tactile feeling giving you better accuracy over a standard membrane keyboard. With Mechanical Keyboards you get the benifit of being able to customize your experience with different keycaps and switches affecting the amount of pressure nessassary per keypress and giving your board the sound you may be looking for.</p>
