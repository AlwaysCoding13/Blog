                    <h1>Never Enough Time</h1>
                    <p>In this field it's an infinite pool of information and it's hard to find what to focus your time into. With as many frameworks and languages and "Stacks" you can learn it can be overwhelming to focus in one just one thing. I spend a lot of my time "learning" but I find that it's difficult to properly allocate time into different tasks while maintaining constant progression. I often ask myself if i'm taking on too much at once and not mastering one thing. As the saying goes "Jack of all trades, Master of none". I hope to find the right work/study/life balance soon enough, but its always a race against the clock.</p>
