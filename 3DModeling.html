                    <h1>3D Modeling</h1>
                    <p>I consider myself to be a creator of some sort and love art of all kinds. For example I collect Vinyl Figures created by many artists that come from different mediums like graffiti, traditional paiting, and sculpting. These artists are able to transform their 2D creations into 3D figues that you can move and animate. While I have a passion for art it's not my strong suit but with 3D software it feels more approchable because i'm more familir with tech mediums over a paint brush. I've finished one render so far using Blender with the help of a "Blender Guru" tutorial and look forward to trying to do some more!</p>
