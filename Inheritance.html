                <h1>Inheritance</h1>
                <p>Inheritance is known as one of the main pillars of object oriented programming. With Inheritance it makes it easier to reuse code by inheriting fields and methods from a base class. This also has the added benifit of having <em>"cleaner"</em> code.
                    Inheritance is an "IS-A" relationship, meaning that for example you would have say a base class of "Person" and a derived class "Student". The base class "Person" might have fields such as first and last name, and since a student "IS-A" person it would make sense for them to also have those fields so rather then recoding the same fields you can inherit those fields and add on any additional fields that are only nessassary to the derived class "Student" like a student-ID or email.
                When using Inheritance it's important to think out what fields and methods are useful to all of the derived classes to reduce the amount of repeated code.</p>
