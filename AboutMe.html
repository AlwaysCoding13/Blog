                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>Hi my name is Ian Atkisson, I'm a first year computer science student at Renton Technical College. Since I was a child, I've loved hobbies of all kinds. Learning new abilities and seeing my progress always brought me joy. Tech has always been one of my favorite hobbies to spend time with. Whether it be building a new pc, trying to automate my home with smart devices, playing games on Xbox and PC, or just watching and reading about new upcoming tech. Other than tech i'm really into "skill toys" such as Kendama, Yo-Yo, Fingerboarding, and Balisong. I love that you can see the progression and that there's always room for improvement.</p>
